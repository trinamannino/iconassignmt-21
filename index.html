        <h3>September 30, 2021</h3>

        <p>Even as Broadway and cultural institutions are reopening, a contingency of performing artists expressed that they were considering defecting to new fields earlier this year. Though reasons for leaving differ, the trend overlaps with the pandemic. Artists interviewed in my article <a href="https://allarts.org/2021/04/covid-19-performing-arts/">"Performers Eye New Fields During the COVID-19 Pandemic"</a> are now applying to medical, law and business schools. They’re becoming paralegals, physical therapists and doulas. Creatives from all over — from Canton, Ohio, to San Francisco, Calif. — are trading gig life for a chance at a steady paycheck and paid vacation time. Some are simply ready for something new. At this juncture, it’s unclear on the severity of the exodus. Several reports and articles point to a shift, portending that the performing arts ecology will look different in the foreseeable future.</p>

    <p>To some extent, attrition in any industry is natural. Goals shift. Identities recalibrate. Yet, the pandemic brought to light issues — such as unfair contract practices, unemployment benefits for freelancers and access to healthcare — that, if left unaddressed, will lead to a smaller and more homogenized workforce in the performing arts.</p>
